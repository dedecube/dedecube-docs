## Installing and Using CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has thousands of libraries and can help you scale your projects elegantly. Below are the steps to install and use CocoaPods on a Mac.

## Installation

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. **Install CocoaPods**: Once Homebrew is installed, you can install CocoaPods by running:

   ```bash
   brew install cocoapods
