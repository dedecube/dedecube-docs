## Useful commands

1. **Multiple Version Management:** Utilize fvm list to see all installed versions, helping you manage and switch between them effortlessly:

   ```bash
   fvm list
   ```

2  **Set a Global Default Version**: For consistency across projects, you can set a global default Flutter version that FVM will default to for any new project:

   ```bash
   fvm global <version>
   ```
