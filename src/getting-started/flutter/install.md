## Installation

1. **Install FVM**: You can install FVM using Homebrew on macOS with the following commands:

   ```bash
   brew tap leoafarias/fvm
   brew install fvm
   ```

2. **Install Flutter SDK**: Use FVM to install and manage different Flutter SDK versions. Start by installing a specific version:

   ```bash
   fvm install <version>
   ```

::: warning
Note: If FVM is already installed, ensure that it is version 3.x.x or higher. If it is not updated, use its autoupdate feature to update it. However, if FVM was installed using external package managers like Homebrew, update it using those package managers instead.
