## Installing Homebrew on your mac

Homebrew is a powerful package manager for macOS, simplifying the installation and management of software.

## Download and install

1. **Run the Install Script**: Open Terminal and copy and paste the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. **Add Homebrew to Your PATH**: Update your shell configuration file (like .zshrc or .bash_profile) to include Homebrewâ€™s bin directory:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:\$PATH\"' >> ~/.zshrc"

3. **Refresh shell**: Apply the changes by sourcing:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "source ~/.zshrc"
